A program that starts counting seconds when you press Enter, and stops when you press Enter again.
Concepts: time module, while loops, basic logic.

BIP 2 -> Hangman Game

The classic guessing game where the player guesses letters of a hidden word, with a limited number of attempts.
Concepts: lists, string manipulation, loops, conditionals.

BIP 3 -> Basic Alarm Clock

Description:
You enter a time, and the program plays a sound or prints a message when that time comes.
Concepts: time comparison, loops, scheduling.

BIP 4 -> Contact Book

Description:
Add, search, and delete contacts stored in a dictionary. Can be saved to a file to persist.
